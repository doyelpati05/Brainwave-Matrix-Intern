# Internship Projects – Brainwave Matrix Solution

This repository contains two internship tasks completed under **Brainwave Matrix Solution**. These projects reflect my interest in cybersecurity and user safety, combining practical utility with hands-on learning.

## 🔐 1. Password Strength Checker

**Description:**  
A Java-based tool that analyzes the strength of a user's password using various parameters like length, character types, and predictability.

**Features:**
- Evaluates passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong
- Checks for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Gives real-time feedback to users

## 🛡️ 2. Phishing Link Scanner

**Description:**  
A tool that scans and analyzes URLs to determine whether they may be malicious or part of phishing scams.

**Features:**
- Identifies suspicious patterns in links
- Uses domain and keyword checks to flag potentially harmful URLs
- Offers basic real-time results for user safety

## 🚀 Purpose & Learning

Both of these tools are simple but powerful applications that taught me a lot about:
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- String handling and validation in Java
- Writing efficient, readable, and user-friendly code

## 📁 How to Run

> Both projects are written in Java and can be executed from any standard Java IDE or command line.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Integrating both tools into a unified desktop or web application
- Adding database logging and reporting features
- Using machine learning APIs for advanced phishing detection
